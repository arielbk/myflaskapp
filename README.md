# myflaskapp

This is a simple add in which you can register and login, and proceed to add or edit articles that are then publicly viewable.

This was created as a practice project, following along with a tutorial on YouTube for creating Flask applications by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA).

It uses Python and Flask on the backend, and MySQL for databases.

Because this is just a practice run, this app has not been deployed. Check out my repo for Kalender App; it has been inspired by this, but uses a PostgreSQL database and is deployed on Heroku.
